            <p>Welcome to my games web page. I personally love games of all sorts, video games, board games, card games,
                but generally not head games. On this page I will be cataloguing and describing some of the games I have
                at
                home.
                You will also be able to add some of your favorite games.
            </p>

            <h3>Here are some of the categories for my board games</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Family games</strong> These are games that are good for all ages. Some of my favorites
                    include
                    Connect 4, Pickomino, and parchisi.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Logic Games</strong> This is my favorite board game category. This could actually be broken
                    up
                    into
                    several sub-categories as well. We have friends that come over for a monthly game night, and we
                    usually
                    play
                    an epic game like Terraforming Mars, Puerto Rico, or Domaine. These are games that tend to last 2-3
                    hours,
                    sometimes even longer. Other logic games that are more in keeping with the typical 30-45 minute
                    family
                    game
                    include domination and blockus.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Party Games</strong> These are games that are more fun the more people you have. Usually,
                    while
                    there is still a winner, winning isn't the goal so much as laughing is. When I have a group of
                    people
                    over
                    who have different intersts and gaming backgrounds, I like to play Monikers, Cards Against Humanity,
                    Poetry
                    for Neanderthals or Taboo.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Other Games</strong> Some games either fit multiple categories or don't quite fit into the
                    categories
                    listed above, so they are in the "other" category. I included all of my two-player-only games,
                    such as pentago, backgammon, and hive as well as some hard-to classify card games like exploding
                    kittens
                    and
                    Here to Slay.
