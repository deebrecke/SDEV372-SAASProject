<p>Welcome to my games web page. I personally love games of all sorts, video games, board games, card games,
    but generally not head games. On this page I will be cataloguing and describing some of the games I have at home.
    You will also be able to add some of your favorite games.

    <h3>Here are some of the categories for my board games</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Family games</strong> These are games that are good for all ages. Some of my favorites include
            Connect 4, Pickomino, and parchisi.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Logic Games</strong> This is my favorite board game category. This could actually be broken up into
            several sub-categories as well. We have friends that come over for a monthly game night, and we usually play
            an epic game like Terraforming Mars, Puerto Rico, or Domaine. These are games that tend to last 2-3 hours,
            sometimes even longer. Other logic games that are more in keeping with the typical 30-45 minute family game
            include domination and blockus.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Party Games</strong> These are games that are more fun the more people you have. Usually, while
            there is still a winner, winning isn't the goal so much as laughing is. When I have a group of people over
            who have different intersts and gaming backgrounds, I like to play Monikers, Cards Against Humanity, Poetry
            for Neanderthals or Taboo.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Other Games</strong> Some games either fit multiple categories or don't quite fit into the
            categories
            listed above, so they are in the "other" category. I included all of my two-player-only games,
            such as pentago, backgammon, and hive as well as some hard-to classify card games like exploding kittens and
            Here to Slay.
        </li>
    </ul>
