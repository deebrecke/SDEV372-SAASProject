## Project Description
This is a quarter long project for SDEV 372: Software as a Service
I created an API with information about games in my collection.
I have two classes--one for board games and one for video games.
It now allows the user to add games, edit them,
and delete records from the tables. This was done using asynchronous 
functions in javascript.
